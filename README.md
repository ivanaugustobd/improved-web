# Improved Web
Usertyles compatible CSS to "improve" some websites I use. So it's too personal to be really usable be anyone else, but can be a reference for you to build your own :)
Just need Stylus extension on your browser, then open the [styles.user.css](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivanaugustobd/improved-web/master/styles.user.css) raw file to install it.
