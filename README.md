# Improved Web
Usertyles compatible CSS to "improve" some websites I use. So it's too personal to be really usable be anyone else, but can be a reference for you to build your own :)

# How to use
Just need Stylus extension on your browser ([Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/) / [Chrome-like](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne)), then open the [styles.user.css](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivanaugustobd/improved-web/master/styles.user.css) raw file to install it.

# How to make your own
- fork this repo;
- press . (dot) on your keyboard to start editing;
- go to _styles.user.css_ file and change the domains / CSS rules respecting the structure used by existing ones;
- click [here](styles.user.css) from your README.md and then click on the RAW button there;
- install it and enjoy a new web experience fitting your needs!
